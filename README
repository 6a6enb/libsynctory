                           libsynctory

  What is it?
  -----------

  libsynctory is a free software library implementing a rolling checksum
  algorithm of remote file synchronization similar to the one used by
  rsync and librsync. This algorithm transfers the differences between 2 
  files without needing both files on the same system.

  Other than librsync, libsynctory uses stronger checksums to identify
  recognized file chunks. Therefore, libsynctory produces results of higher
  reliability than librsync, but the amount of data used to do so is also
  considerably higher.

  Therefore, libsynctory is rather designed for offline use (e. g. in
  backup solutions) rather than for life data transmissions.


  What is it not?
  ---------------

  libsynctory is not a drop-in replacement for librsync. The interface of
  the library was designed to meet the KISS principle without caring for
  compatibility with other, similar software.
