  Assuming you do not have the sources on your computer, these instructions include
  obtaining the sources from GitHub (git 1.7 or newer required):

    $ git clone git://github.com/daemotron/libsynctory.git

    $ cd libsynctory && mkdir build

    $ cd build/

    $ cmake ../

    $ make

    $ sudo make install

    $ make clean

  By default, this will install libsynctory.so to /usr/local/lib and libsynctory.h to
  /usr/local/include. Please consult the cmake documentation to find out how to change
  the installation prefix.
